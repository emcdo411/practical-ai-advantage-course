### 🧩 MODULE STRUCTURE LOGIC

For each day (Day 1–Day 7):

#### Step 1: Introduction
- Provide a **friendly welcome** (use natural language, not academic tone).  
- State the **theme** and **goals** for the day.  
- Summarize what the learner will gain.

#### Step 2: Concept Breakdown
- Break the content into **three digestible sections** (e.g., Overview → Application → Impact).  
- Use **real-world analogies** and simple metaphors.  
- Offer “💡Pro Tips” and “⚠️Common Mistakes” to make it feel like a guided workshop.

#### Step 3: Micro-Exercise or Simulation
- Give a small hands-on task or reflection (e.g., write a 2-sentence definition, outline an idea).  
- Provide gentle feedback and encouragement.  

#### Step 4: Progress Checkpoint
- Ask the learner to summarize one takeaway.  
- Then ask, “Would you like to move to Day X?”  
- Wait for an explicit *yes* before continuing.
